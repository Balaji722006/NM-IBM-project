# 🧾 Interactive Form Validation

An **Interactive Form Validation** project designed to enhance user experience by providing **real-time feedback** on form inputs. This project ensures data accuracy, improves usability, and prevents submission of incomplete or invalid data.

---

## 🚀 Features

* ✅ **Real-time validation** for form inputs (email, password, username, etc.)
* ⚡ **Instant feedback** using visual indicators (success/error messages)
* 🔒 **Secure validation rules** for sensitive inputs like passwords
* 🧠 **User-friendly interface** with responsive design
* 🎨 **Dynamic styling** using CSS transitions and animations

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used

* **HTML5** – Structure of the form
* **CSS3** – Styling and user feedback visuals
* **JavaScript (ES6)** – Client-side validation logic
* *(Optional)* **Bootstrap / Tailwind CSS** – For responsive design
* *(Optional)* **Regex** – For pattern-based validation

## 🧩 Validation Features

| Field                | Validation Criteria                                                                 |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Username**         | Minimum length, no special characters                                               |
| **Email**            | Must follow proper email format (e.g., [user@example.com](mailto:user@example.com)) |
| **Password**         | Minimum 8 characters, at least one number, one uppercase letter                     |
| **Confirm Password** | Must match the entered password                                                     |
| **Phone Number**     | Must contain only digits and be of valid length                                     |

## 💡 How It Works

1. User enters data into the form fields.
2. JavaScript checks each field in real-time.
3. If the input is invalid, an error message or red border appears.
4. Once all fields are valid, the form can be successfully submitted.

## 📸 Screenshots (Optional)

> Add screenshots or GIFs showing validation in action.
